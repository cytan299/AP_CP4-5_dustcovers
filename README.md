# AP CP4-5 dust covers

![Covers](https://github.com/cytan299/AP_CP4-5_dustcovers/blob/main//pics/covers.jpg)

I created dust covers for CP4 and CP5 controllers. The full size
covers cover all the sockets. The partial size covers leave the
encoder and the motor sockets uncovered.

The covers were created using OpenScad. The source files are in the
_source_ subdirectory:

* **CP4-CP5_case.scad** The full size dust covers.
* **CP4-CP5_partial_case.scad** the partial size dust covers

The STL files generated by OpenScad are in the _STL_ subdirectory:

* **CP4-CP5_case.stl** The full size dust covers.
* **CP4-CP5_partial_case.stl** the partial size dust covers
